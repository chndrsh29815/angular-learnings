1. to represent class a component angular uses @Component directive which includes an object.

```TS
@Component({
    selector: 'app-header',
    standalone: true,
    templateUrl: './header.component.html'

})

```

2. From angular 18 and newer version standalone property included.
3. we can directly describe html code with template
